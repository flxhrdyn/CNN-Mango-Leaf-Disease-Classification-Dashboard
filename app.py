    1. **Anthracnose** 

    Anthracnose is a disease caused by the fungus *Colletotrichum gloeosporioides*. 
    It is one of the diseases that affect mango leaves, flowers, and fruits. 
    Symptoms of anthracnose on leaves include the appearance of gray or brown spots with dark edges. O
    n mango fruits, the disease manifests as dark circular lesions, sometimes sunken, reaching a size of 4‚Äì5 cm. 
    This fungus is spread through rainwater and can develop in a relative humidity of around 95%.

    2. **Bacterial Canker**

    Black spot (*Bacterial Canker*) is a disease caused by the bacterium *Xanthomonas citri*. 
    This disease appears on both mango fruits and leaves. In severe cases, it can lead to the drying and shedding of mango leaves and fruits.
    The black spots on the fruit may exude sap, which can spread the pathogen to other mango trees. 
    This disease can reduce the quality of mango fruits and weaken the tree trunk.

    3. **Powdery Mildew**

    Powdery Mildew is a disease caused by the pathogen *Oidium mangiferae*. 
    This disease leads to fungal growth that can infect leaves, young fruits, and flowers, ultimately reducing mango fruit yields. 
    Symptoms on leaves include the appearance of gray spots that can gradually cover the entire leaf surface, causing them to wither and die. 
    This disease also causes mango flowers and young fruits to die and fall off, further decreasing the harvest. 
    Warm temperatures between 10‚Äì31¬∞C and air humidity of 60‚Äì90% provide ideal conditions for the development of this fungus.

    4. **Healthy Leaves**

    A healthy mango leaf is vibrant green, firm, and free from blemishes or deformities. 
    It has a smooth, glossy surface with a well-defined central vein and smaller veins branching symmetrically. 
    The leaf margins are usually slightly wavy but intact, without signs of curling, yellowing, or browning. 
    A healthy leaf should not have spots, lesions, or fungal growth. 
    Additionally, it remains securely attached to the tree, showing no signs of premature wilting or shedding. 
    Proper nutrition, adequate watering, and good air circulation contribute to maintaining healthy mango leaves.

    1. **The Model** 

    The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is designed for classifying mango leaf diseases using deep learning. 
    It begins with five **convolutional layers**, each using **3√ó3 filters** with **ReLU activation** to detect features such as edges, textures, and patterns in the images. 
    After each convolutional layer, a **max-pooling layer** reduces the spatial dimensions, improving computational efficiency and helping the model focus on the most important features. 
    The extracted features are then **flattened** and passed through a **fully connected dense layer** with **256 neurons**, which allows the model to learn complex patterns. 
    A **dropout layer (0.2)** is applied to prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training. 
    Finally, the **output layer** consists of **four neurons** with **softmax activation**, enabling the model to classify images into one of four categories. 
    This architecture ensures the model effectively captures disease patterns while maintaining generalization ability.
